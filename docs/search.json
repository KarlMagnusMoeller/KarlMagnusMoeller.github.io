    "text": "Until this January, I was a PhD student in the Department of Political Science, Aarhus University affiliated with the Comparative Politics section. Before that, I studied at Copenhagen Business School and the London School of Economics (see my teaching and other professional experience). In my work, I do research that can help us understand the political obstacles to — and ultimately speed up — decarbonisation (see myresearch papers). I am particularly interested in the interplay between markets and politics, including the potential for policy-led industrial transformations that feed back into the political process. My PhD research focuses specifically on the political effects of expanding renewable energy industries at the level of countries, firms, and voters. Essentially, I ask whether the domestic growth of these industries make countries more willing and able to phase out fossil fuels through ambitious climate and energy policy and why (not).\nWhen I’m not trying to answer these questions, I am mostly hanging out with my two kids on the many playgrounds in and around Aarhus, cooking them food they will most likely refuse to eat (unless it’s porridge), running, or obsessing over coffee."

    "text": "Carbon pricing scores\nThe OECD has provided a fantastic public service to those interested in comparative climate policy by calculating not only explicit carbon prices but the total taxation of energy-related CO2 emissions that results from various energy-related policy instruments including explicit carbon prices, emissions trading schemes and fuel excise taxes. Specifically, the CPS measures the share of emissions priced at a given price level (30, 60, or 120 USD) or above The downside of this data is that it covers just 44 countries for three years; 2012, 2015, and 2018. This illustrates how demanding the creation of more encompassing climate policy indicators is. The data is described in the OECD report series entitled Effective Carbon Rates.1 You can switch between tabs to get a disaggregated view of Carbon Pricing Scores at a sectoral level.\n\nAll sectorsRoadOff-roadIndustryAgricultureBuildingsElectricity"

This is reflected in increasing efforts to measure fossil fuel subsidy amounts among international organisations including the OECD, IMF and IEA. The website fossilfuelsubsidytracker.org combines these data sources into one data set. The methods used across organisations are not entirely comparable (see the methodology page on fossilfuelsubsidytracker.org). For that reason, groups of countries are shown separately based on which organisation constitutes the main source of country data.2 Data is presented relative to both gross domestic product (in current USD, like the subsidy data) and relative to population figures.\n\nIEA data (GDP)IEA data (p.c.)OECD data (GDP)OECD data (p.c.)"

The idea that stronger domestic renewable energy industries increase the political feasibility of stringent energy and climate policies aiming to phase out fossil fuels has been championed by proponents of policy sequencing and underpins the global pivot to green industrial policy. Yet, the conditions necessary for such an effect to materialize have not been fully spelled out and its empirical veracity not been systematically scrutinized. This paper contends that the willingness and ability of renewable energy industries to influence policy should be weaker for fossil fuel phaseout policies compared to green industrial policies because of more diffuse material interests, less access to policymaking, and stronger countermobilization. The first large-scale investigation of this relation using extensive time-series cross-sectional data provides no evidence of a systematic positive effect of renewable energy industry strength on carbon pricing or fossil fuel subsidy phaseouts. These findings challenge the widespread argument that the emergence of domestic low-carbon industries translates into more ambitious decarbonization policy.

Scholarship on the geographically concentrated negative effects of local fossil fuel dependencies and wind turbine construction shows this. Yet, existing work focused on the local causes of climate policy backlash has not considered the rise of low-carbon industries. A central, but largely untested, assumption underpinning the global embrace of green industrial policy is that the emergence of green industries that generates local jobs and growth will have positive (feedback) effects on popular support for the energy transition more generally. In this article, I spell out the demanding causal chain necessary for that effect to materialize and test this argument using the uniquely suitable case of the wind energy industry in Denmark. I collect novel geocoded data on wind industry production sites and test the association between local wind industry presence and pro- and anti-climate voting in Danish parliamentary elections from 2007 to 2022 at the level of electoral precincts. Consistent null results reveal that the presence of this structurally important renewable energy industry has not meaningfully increased popular support for the energy transition at the local level. Mechanism tests indicate that local wind industries do generate heightened local interest and media attention, but that the industry-policy link is not salient, and that citizens’ climate policy preferences remain unaffected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Investments, No Electoral Reward: The Inflation Reduction Act, Low-carbon Investments, and the 2024 US Presidential Election\nWorking paper available on OSF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is one of the most prominent cases of green industrial policy. It was motivated by a strategic intention of increasing popular support for both climate policy and the Democratic party. Since its passage in August 2022, large private-sector investments in low-carbon manufacturing have been announced in many electorally pivotal areas in the United States. The expectation that these spatially concentrated benefits would boost local support for the pro-climate incumbent party – the Democrats – is supported by political science theories of local economic voting, mass feedback effects, and climate policy sequencing. Using propensity score matching and a difference-in-differences design, I estimate the causal effect of these announced low-carbon investments on the county-level two-party vote share of the Democratic party in the 2024 presidential election. I identify a substantially negligible and statistically insignificant positive effect (β = 0.153, 95% CI = [-0.100;0.405]) that is stable across various robustness checks. Given the most-likely nature of this case, my findings raise more general questions about the ability of green industrial policies to generate short-term electoral rewards and hereby challenge a core motivation for this increasingly prevalent climate policy strategy."
