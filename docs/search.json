    "text": "I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science, Aarhus University in Denmark affiliated with the Comparative Politics section. In my work, I am trying my best to do research that can help us understand the political obstacles to, and ultimately speed up, decarbonisation. My PhD research focuses specifically on the political effects of expanding renewable energy industries. Do countries where these industries become economically important also become more willing and able to phase out fossil fuels through ambitious climate and energy policy?\nWhen Iâ€™m not pondering how best to answer this question, I am mostly hanging out with my two kids on the many playgrounds in and around Aarhus or cooking them food they will most likely refuse to eat (unless it is porridge).\nThis website contains an overview of my working papers and other projects as well as a list of my teaching and other professional experience."

Based on data from ISSP 2010, I offer a preliminary answer. Factors associated with believing in green growth include being highly educated, politically right wing, having high socio-economic status, and having managerial employment. Several of these findings indicate that those who are further removed from the extractive and manufacturing processes that result in environmental degradation may perceive the prospects for green growth as being more realistic."

Bechtel, Genovese, and Scheve (2019) make an important contribution to this strand of research by showing that employment in high-emissions sectors more generally has a substantially large, negative influence on a set of general climate politics opinions.

    "text": "Carbon pricing scores\nThe OECD has provided a fantastic public service to those interested in comparative climate policy by calculating not only explicit carbon prices but the total taxation of energy-related CO2 emissions that results from various energy-related policy instruments including explicit carbon prices, emissions trading schemes and fuel excise taxes. Specifically, the CPS measures the share of emissions prices at at least a given price level (30, 60, or 120 USD). The downside of this data is that it covers just 44 countries for three years; 2012, 2015, and 2018. This illustrates how demanding the creation of more encompassing climate policy indicators really is. Switch between tabs to get a disaggregated view of Carbon Pricing Scores at a sectoral level.\n\nAll sectorsRoadOff-roadIndustryAgricultureBuildingsElectricity"
